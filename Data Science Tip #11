Model accuracy can be visualized using the following metrics:
For Classification Type Problems:
1. Confusion Matrix
2. Classification Report

For Regression Type Problems:
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics will help you evaluate if the model is able to predict good results (High Accuracy & Low Error).
