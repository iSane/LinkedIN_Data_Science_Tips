Even though the name contains Regression, a Logistic Regression is a classification type algorithm.

E.g. To predict whether an email is Spam/ Not Spam. If a Batch is Good/ Bad.

To predict which class the data point belongs to, a threshold value can be set. Based on this threshold, a probability value is calculated which is then converted to a class.

E.g. if the predicted probability â‰¥ 0.5, then classify the email as spam else, not spam.
