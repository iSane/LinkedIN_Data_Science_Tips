# LinkedIN_Data_Science_Tips
The source code for all the Data Science tips that I put on my LinkedIn Profile

I have been working in Data Science for the past 1+ yearsâ€™ at Altizon Inc. and would like to share this knowledge in the form of handy tips for fellow analysts. I use Python, MS Excel, and BI tools for these analyses. These tips have saved my time and will be a handy tool for other analysts.

I will be focusing on these 4 components:
1. Miscellaneous
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
